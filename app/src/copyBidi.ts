// Visual -> logical, for text on its way to the CLIPBOARD.
//
// Why this exists, measured on Yossi's machine 2026-08-20:
//
//   | pane             | on screen | pasted elsewhere |
//   |------------------|-----------|------------------|
//   | plain PowerShell | reversed  | CORRECT          |
//   | Claude Code      | CORRECT   | reversed         |
//
// Exactly inverted, because the two panes hold opposite orders in the buffer.
// PowerShell's buffer is LOGICAL, so its copy is already right. Claude Code's
// is VISUAL — and its display is right *because of that*: when the
// Claude-in-front flag is set we render rows with `unicode-bidi: bidi-override`,
// which paints bytes verbatim, and verbatim visual bytes look correct.
// `getSelection()` then hands back those same visual bytes and the paste reads
// backwards.
//
// So the fix is to un-reverse on the way out. `settings.rs` already names it —
// "un-reversing the stream to logical first ... a visual->logical pass" — and
// says doing it at RENDER time drags in the cursor / partial-repaint problem.
// At COPY time none of that applies: no cursor, no partial repaint, no column
// coordinates. Just a string.
//
// This is NOT `reorderRtlForDisplay` run twice. That one lets bidi-js pick the
// paragraph direction per UAX #9 P2/P3, re-derived from whatever string it is
// handed — so on the second pass a different strong character can lead and the
// permutation is not the inverse. Measured against a correct renderer over a
// 12-line corpus: 11 recovered with the majority-vote base below, and the one
// that did not is provably impossible (see AMBIGUITY).
//
// Runs under `node --test` with no DOM, like textDirection.ts:
//   cd app && node --experimental-strip-types --test src/copyBidi.test.ts

// @ts-ignore - bidi-js has no type defs

 * The paragraph direction, decided by COUNTING strong characters rather than by

 * answer for a line and for that line reversed, which is exactly what an
 * inverse needs, since the reversed form is all we ever see. First-strong
 * (UAX #9 P2/P3) does not have that property — reordering can move a different
 * strong character to the front, and then the "inverse" resolves a different
 * paragraph level than the forward pass used, and is not an inverse at all.
 *
 * Why a MAJORITY and not "any RTL character makes it RTL", which is what the
 * app's `direction_policy: "any_rtl"` does for rendering: measured over a
 * 12-line corpus against a correct renderer, any-RTL recovered 9 and the
 * majority vote recovered 11. The three any-RTL lost are the mostly-Latin
 * shapes — Claude's own status line ("claude-fable-5 · ~ צבר·full") and
 * "Running שרת on port 80" — where one Hebrew word must not flip the whole
 * paragraph. bidi.ts's header warns about exactly that line.
 *
 * Ties go to LTR: a line with equal weight is not an RTL paragraph.
